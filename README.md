# Git-Repository---A3-Project

I have uploaded the Scratch file here as well as a link to the Scratch game for a web browser. My entire game is uploaded onto Scratch so all that is required is access to this application.
  For quick access here is the link: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/725163753
I have also uploaded each sprite (image) that was of use in the game.
